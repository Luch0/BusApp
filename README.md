# BusApp

This app is in development. The goal of this app is use the MTA bustime API to create a simple and easy to use application
in order for the commuter to track the location of MTA buses according to corresponding routes.

I use the MTA bus service almost everytime I go out, either to work, appointments or other places. Since I found out that the MTA implemented a way to track buses in real time, I started using it to check where my bus was. The service is very useful and there's almost never a problem. The only thing that I did not like about it was the website that they offer. The bustime web service I feel it's not very user friendly so I decided to create an app that would be alot easier to use.

First I did some research and found out that the MTA Bustime has a developer website (http://bustime.mta.info/wiki/Developers/Index) where I could find documentation and steps to take to access the real time data. The first thing I had to do was request an API key through the wesite in order to have access to the data needed to create the bus app. After obtaining the API key I had to learn how to make requests using Java in order to receive the response needed.
